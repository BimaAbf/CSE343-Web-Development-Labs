Build a simple to do list 
- Build a simple to do list web page app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- HTML Structure (Minimum Requirements):
    - An Inpust Field for Tasks Description.
    - An "Add task" button.
    - A list <ul> or <div> to display Tasks
- JavaScript Structure (Minimum Requirements):
    - Store tasks in an array, Web Cache, or JSON File (I prefer the JSON idea)
    - Add tasks dynamically to the page using innerHTMl or DOM manipulation
    - Allow toggling a task's completion state by clicking on it (Change text style or color)
    - Allow Deleting a task.
    - Use Simple CSS to mark completed tasks with a strike-through or color change.

- Make it look good (Experiment with css but not advanced CSS as I will have to explain it, so make it simple)
